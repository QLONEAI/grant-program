### Overview
With the leverage of AI & Blockchain, Qlone's infrastructure is aiming to provide an all-in-one solution to generate your smart-digital AR clone. A new seamless approach on how to simulate, train, personalize, and manage AI on the blockchain.
The technology that innovates fields like personal AI, Gaming, Customer service, Education, and more...
An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project within the VeChain Ecosystem.
VeChain is one of the best blockchains for our team due to its high level of security and decentralization, fast transactions & low gas fees, and can't forget about enabled smart contracts. Last but not least, Vechain is EVM compatible, which makes it easy to port solidity code because we are familiar with it.


### Project Details
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.
Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

## Development Roadmap


This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.


Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:


- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost.
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
