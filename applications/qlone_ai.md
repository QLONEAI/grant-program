### Overview
With the leverage of AI & Blockchain, Qlone's infrastructure is aiming to provide an all-in-one solution to generate your smart-digital AR clone. A new seamless approach on how to simulate, train, personalize, and manage AI on the blockchain.
The technology that innovates fields like personal AI, Gaming, Customer service, Education, and more...
An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project within the VeChain Ecosystem.
VeChain is one of the best blockchains for our team due to its high level of security and decentralization, fast transactions & low gas fees, and can't forget about enabled smart contracts. Last but not least, Vechain is EVM compatible, which makes it easy to port solidity code because we are familiar with it.


### Project Details
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.
Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
- Mockups/designs of any UI components
https://docsend.com/view/8qrh7ugx864p2pi3

- API specifications of the core functionality

Backend created using Python programming language and Django framework. For database we used Postgresql. And for communication we use Representational State Transfer (REST) standart. Authentification based on bearer tokens. For the frontend we use react native framework and JavaScript language and provide both android and iOS applications.

For image to image model training we use modified version of open source stable diffusion automatic1111. First user in application frontend uploads one example image or selects from offered options. Also selects preferred style. Then submits info data will be sent to backend and then text info passed to GPT-4 trained AI model which generated full extended prompt for nft generator. After this step prompt are tokenized by a CLIP tokenizer, created by Open AI to produce text description. Finally all info is being processed to Depth-to-image and a new images are produced with additional conditioning using a depth map. After this we have nfts images and some predefined meta data for these images. Next all this info are passed to smart contract which are Deployed on Kusama chain. And finally all info about successful nft mint are passed to user.

- An overview of the technology stack to be used

  Adversarial Networks (GANs) 
  Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
  Large Language Models (LoRA)
  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
  GPT-4 natural language AI model
  Machine learning
  JavaScript
  Python
  Rust

- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

https://github.com/QLONEAI

- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

We have a functional app prototype, and multiple AI models and blockchain integrations are already available.
The development team managed to generate our own GAN, RNN AI model prototypes which will be more cost-effective for future sales.

### Ecosystem Fit
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?

AI NFT generator is really demanding tool for any blockchain. Vechain ecosystem could be one of the first blockchain to integrate AI into WEB3 with the help of our team. AI cloning tolls, and generators are useful tools for many businesses and people, we have multiple AI models prepared to merge. Our application will be the first one to offer many AI features that are not available on mobile. In add, our AI models will be available in one infrastructure which will give seamless access to users with no need to transfer through other platforms.

## Development Roadmap


This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.


Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:


- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost.
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
